# `Using k-means, different groups of customers have been identified`
The overall strategy would be preserving the most favourable customer group — the green one — while moving the blue customer group to the red and purple areas.

Blue group is 42% of all customers, any improvements achieved in this customer group will dramatically increase the revenue. Eliminating high return rates and offering gift cards can move this customer group to low-average-return-rate and high-total-spending area. If we assume that they are newcomers, gift cards can expedite their come-back.

Red and purple group together consists of 50% of all customers. They are showing the same characteristics from the average return rate and products ordered perspectives but differ from total spending. These groups can be defined as who already know the brand and orders multiple products. Those customers can be kept up-to-date with the brand with some specialized communications and discounts.

Green customer group consists of 8% of all customers, forming the most favourable customer group for the brand. They order multiple products and they are highly likely to keep them. To maintain and possibly expand this group, special deals and pre-product launches might help. Moreover, they can be magnets for new customers impacting the expansion of the customer base.
